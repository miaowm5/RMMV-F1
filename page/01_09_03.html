		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Name </h3>
		  <p>The name of the map event. This property is just used in the editor (does not affect the game). The name that uses the ID will be automatically entered in the initial state. Change the name of the event to something easily identifiable if necessary. </p>

		  <p> A text area where you can freely enter notes. </p>

		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Event Page Control Buttons </h3>
		  <p>The buttons located towards the top of the window can be used to perform actions such as creating new event pages and deleting them. The functions of each button are as follows.</p>
		  <dl class="main__dl--sub">
			<dt>New Event Page </dt>
				<dd>Creates a new consecutively numbered event page following the one that is currently being edited. Each following additional event page will have an ID that increases by 1 each time one is created.</dd>
				<dt>Copy Event Page</dt>
				<dd>Copies the contents of the event page currently being edited to the clipboard.</dd>
				<dt>Paste Event Page </dt>

		    Leave the condition settings as disabled when you want to have an event occur without any conditions. If multiple conditions are set, an event will only occur when all conditions are met.<br />
  <br />
		    If the conditions of multiple event pages are met, the event with the ID with the highest value will be used. Conversely, an event will not occur if there are no pages which meet the conditions set. </p>

Double-clicking a row which already has an event command will insert the new event command in that position.</p>
		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Controls via the Context Menu </h3>
		  <p>Registered event commands will be displayed using a [◆]. Right-clicking this row will cause a menu to appear where you can perform actions such as [Copy] and [Delete]. Each available action is as follows.</p>
