		    The window is divided into 4 tabs: BGM (background music), BGS (background sound), ME (music effects) and SE (sound effects). You can assign music by clicking on the song in the File List of each tab. When you press [Play] the music will begin to play. Click [Stop] to stop the music.<br />
  <br />
